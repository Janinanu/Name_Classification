# Person Name Classification | Tensorflow | LSTM & CNN

Work in progress. Uploads from February 15.

In this project, I am going to build one LSTM model and one CNN model in Tensorflow to identify the language of origin of person names and compare the performance of both models.
This task becomes relevant in text-to-speech synthesis applications. Only if the system can identify the language of a name, it can choose the proper pronunciation for it. 
E.g. a Russian name appearing within a Spanish language application might then be identified and pronounced in the correct Russian way.

I take inspiration from the following github repo: https://github.com/spro/practical-pytorch

I transfer the model from PyTorch to Tensorflow and modify it in some parts.
