# Person Name Classification | Tensorflow/Keras | LSTM & CNN

Work in progress.

In this project, I am going to build one LSTM model and one CNN model in Keras to identify the language of origin of person names and compare the performance of both models.
This task becomes relevant in text-to-speech synthesis applications. Only if the system can identify the language of a name, it can choose the proper pronunciation for it. 
E.g. a Russian name appearing within a Spanish language application might then be identified and pronounced in the correct Russian way.

I take inspiration from the following github repo: https://github.com/spro/practical-pytorch 

Data taken from: https://github.com/spro/practical-pytorch/tree/master/data/names 

I transfer the model from PyTorch to Keras and modify it in some parts.
