# Tensorflow_Name_Classification

Work in progress

*Uploads starting end of January 2018.*

In this project, I am going to use a bidirectional LSTM in Tensorflow to identify the language of origin of person names. 
This becomes relevant in text-to-speech synthesis applications. Only if the system can identify the language of a name, it can choose the proper pronunciation for it. 

E.g. a Russian name appearing within a Spanish language application might then be identified and pronounced in the correct Russian way.
